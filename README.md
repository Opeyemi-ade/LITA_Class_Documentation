# LITA_Class_Documentation
This is where I documented my journey while learning Data Analysis with the Incubator Hub. Focusing on tools like Excel, (For Data Cleaning, Data Analysis, Data Visualization), SQL, (Structured Query Language for querying Data), Github, ( for Portfolio Building), and Power BI. I will update this repository with notes, exercises, and projects as I progress.
